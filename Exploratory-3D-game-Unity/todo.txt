Parsing questions and displaying them
Determine if you could use UI unity, without creating additional support 
Create UI for each screen
Create 3D ground with interaction
Audio support
Create way for storing new questions, audio etc - they shouuld be packed separetly?


QuestionUI
- holds UI for question scene
QuestionController
- communicates with Model and populates View
QuestionModel
- communicates with file and provides load/store options 
Do I need Controller? 

MainUI
- holds all elements from login screen: selection of game level, saving user id, display of liderboards? 
MainController
- performes loading of level.



Questions:
- scroll bar - just to add support for more than three answers
- scroll bar for editable questions
- add all needed fields for answer and question: fields that user can edit
- when user clicks close button - ask for saving changes? 
- add audio support :/
- add check if everything is okay when editing questions

MainScene:
-leaderboards, filtereing - model for leaderboards 

SCALING of UI canvas/ maybe to have centered everything, and then just background image? Camera - depth only? Clear flags? Background image?



Question -> category

Level -> array of categories, doesn't serialize array of questions - it's done when level is loaded, question can be changed
	  -> array of all possible positions
	  -> name
	  -> max number of questions
	  
	  
Load level: Initialize Level object with questions from all categories, return array of questions with positions
